# PCA-from-scratch
Implementation of principal component analysis over an image

An implementation of the principal component analysis. Each row of the image is considered a feature and each column as an observation, by calculating the eighenvalues and eighenvectors
of it's covariance matrix, we find the principal components and calculate the variance lost.
